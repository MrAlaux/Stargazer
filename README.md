# Stargazer: Mapping Stuff
Stuff you need to contribute to Stargazer Mapping

HOW TO USE THEM?

First you need to open your UDB folder, then find the "Configurations" folder
Once found, open it an drag the "Boom_StargazerDoom.cfg" file onto it
Then go on the "Includes" folder and drag the "Stargazer_things.cfg" and "Stargazer_things2.cfg"
Now you can use the Things on UDB, and you can get to mapping!
