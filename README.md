# Stargazer: Mapping Stuff
Ultimate Doom Builder Configuration files to aid the creation of Stargazer maps 

### HOW TO USE THEM?

First, you need to open your UDB folder, then find the "Configurations" folder.
Once found, open it and drag the "MBF21_StargazerDoom.cfg" file into it.
Then, enter the "Includes" folder and drag "Stargazer_things.cfg" inside.
Now you can use the new Actors on UDB, and you can start mapping!
