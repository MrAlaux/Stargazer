# Stargazer: Mapping Stuff
Ultimate Doom Builder Configuration files to aid the creation of Stargazer maps 

HOW TO USE THEM?

First, you need to open your UDB folder, then find the "Configurations" folder.
Once found, open it and drag the "Boom_StargazerDoom.cfg" file into it.
Then, enter the "Includes" folder and drag "Stargazer_things.cfg" and "Stargazer_things2.cfg" inside.
Now you can use the new Actors on UDB, and you can start mapping!
